          <p><em>Electrical Engineering Graduate from the <strong>University of Calgary</strong>.</em></p>
          <p>Hi!<br><br>
            I am a 2017 Electrical Engineering Graduate from the University of Calgary. Since graduating, I have worked as an Engineering Intern for an aerial data acquisition and geospatial data processing company and as a Project Assistant for a Management System consulting company. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have renewed my passion for learning new skills and adding more tools to my toolbox after taking Barbara Oakley's "Mindshift" course on Coursera. This course has taught me to realize the value in adopting a learning lifestyle, to broaden my passions, and to embrace the idea that personal traits I have previously seen as bad for learning can actually be beneficial traits.<br><br>

            After completing "Mindshift", this experience has pushed me to keep my mind active and to stay busy. I have completed Ardit Sulce's Python course on Udemy where I got the opportunity to build a variety of real-world applications, and I am currently taking Angela Yu's Web Developement Bootcamp to build skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Eventually, I would like to build simple projects that would tie into my passions, namely Hockey and Mixed Martial Arts. I am always looking at completed projects in these areas for inspiration in the future.<br><br>

            In my <a href="hobbies.html">spare time</a>, I am an avid watcher of sitcoms and reality TV, and also love Poker, video games, Photoshop, finding new music, biking, long walks, food, and board games.<br><br>

            I didn't necessarily start learning programming with the singular goal of becoming a full-fledged Programmer, but if there are opportunities where I could potentially apply the bits of knowledge I have gained thus far or if you want to learn more about me and my background, feel free to <a href="contact_info.html">contact</a> me!
